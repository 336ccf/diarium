						Interest is the accumulatabler value. excitement is the high rate interest. 

						Excitement needs to make value of product more valuable. 
						
						When someone see that someone want the same that want person. He want it twice more. 
						
						
						Work hard in way that u like and u make twice more result than u can do before.
						<br>
						_____________
						<br>
						The hardest in every work is planning of process, that will be faster better or simplier. 
						It is the main part of making something strong simplier, than it was in start. 
						
						When u make planning or composing u may think and research the same market that u think. It will make ure result more compitable with others. 
						Because someone already spend time for it, and when u recognise work of another man u create something new in thoughts. 
						
						Do not steal something, in doings. Try to steal sense or thought and refresh it from your mind. 
						
						In the end of work try to think from fundament of work process. think about something that was source of your work. 
						By semantic trees you may find something new. 
						But be careful because semantic tree is most strong structure that human will know. 
						
						Evolution show it in visuallity too - trees or roots is the great example for this moment. 
						<br>
						_______________________
						<br>
						
						Your facilities is worst way to cost yourself. Borders that you build in mind is stop growthing u like a personallity. You need to make sure about your insurance. 
						When you try making decision about your real interest you need to find more than you 10year plus being. 
						Always it is contained in your youth. When you do not understand something. Because it is explain your nature. 
						
						It is strange for finding yourself in teenage years. Because at this time we connected to community and change decision very fast. 
						WE growthing and do not understand yourself. 
						
						Try to find your extension facilities in small doings like drawing thought making. 
						So the most powerfull in understanding yourself is reminding your doings in early years. Thought may categorize your character. Doings may show your real interests. 
						
						Not sure because it is god power. It is chance and your way. Your mind corrected in early years and u will do it better than something else.
						
						When u try to make decision about your interest see past. 
						
						ALTHOUGHT it will be helpful for demand makers. That want to categorize marketing plan for some persons targetly. Try to remember and use it.
						You need to find things that is interest for this sector of year or country, like time and place. 
						For example. People than born at 2000 like something digital and simple. When dig into minds they live in problem stage and they think about ecology and terrorism(It is because they see fukusima or 11 september.)This people try to share trends, they have no borders because internet is really good. They have physically defense from advertising or some useless information. They closed enought because they open yourself in internet(like foreign side). And of course they want great changes that make another.

						The world is complicated. The structures that we create often similar to trees and the growth similar with it too. Every thinking string is ambitious tree that grow up from small sapling and making core more and more, Grow up higher and higher. Make Branches cap and every branch is another direction of one big company. 
						The most part of all creators and makers that create "trees" they have strength to help only one tree. They want to work with one growth structure and do not want to think another way. Because they interested in one "tree". No one see it like making plantation, where everyone make their own tree that connected to one big root. It is not nature, because every tree anyway have different roots. 
						<br>
						Person who create from you something. Need not to give chances to give you chance to think that he/she lie. 
						It is not essential nature. Everybody have solo way, everybody-everyobject, have their own structure and system. We need to understand only one that will make us better like suppling everyone. We do not need make something bad in one environment. We need to size up our thoughts. We need to make all in nature all together all in environment to make something new level.</p>

						Today I work hard with my site. 
						When you make product. Do not waste time to make all similar. Make progress in process and in the end of all try to recognise all of you do and make all in same pattern. 
						
						Sometime we feeling that we are not the same than someone, that we are different it is lie. Lie from your god. From your ego. 
						Do not think that u do not the same. In source of all you are mammal and you need water and oxygen. 
						
						Be strange, be mad. Be stupid be sweat. 
						All humans categorize themselves to characters or some types. Do not think in it. It is human's thought. No one animal do not think that he different. No one animal have ego. 
						<br>
						--------------------]
						<br>
						When you have project make it alive. Make system where you like to see him. Make long way in doing something. Make tasks and targets. Make sure, that you have nice direction.
						
						time is on when you dissolve the projects.
						
						If you want maximalize your project. Do it especially by other possibilities. Do it with someone. Do it and do it. 
						Life is growthing and u cannot stand off.
						
						If u cannot make all orders in one day. Do not try to find another day. Find another worker. 
						<br>
						-------------------------------------
						<br>
						Do not live in same direction for a long time. Powerfull man not a person who do not make problems. Powerfull person is person who live in problems and drive on it.
