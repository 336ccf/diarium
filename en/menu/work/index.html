            <p class="description">I start my career of game-making from small orders for plugins for Minecraft. I start on enthusiasm in 2012 and make it a lot of time. I make about 20 different plugins for CurseForge-Bukkit.
                    My relative give me chance to work in Buka company for PC version of Might&Magic X, in secret, without salary. I had interest and it was enought for me. I work there for 1 month in 2013-2014 year.
                    A lot of time I tried to find game dev chances, but I cannot and I practice on my own during next two years.
                    
                    For 2014-2017 I make Software sometimes. Only for e-orders or for my own targets.
                    I make Mobile Apps, Small business systems, launchers, controllers, generators and something more. I work with 50 different languages and made more than 120 programmes.
                    
                    Web development is the most usefull for me all time. I make about 500 sites and there are all around kinds. About 36-39% I make on code. All other I make in redactors or constructors. 
                    
                    To my own surprise I have chance to work like junior hardware developer on factory. This is awful enought. But it is good experience. I work in 2017 year for 15 days. Earn about 100$ for assistant position and spend for road to work about 60$.</p>

            <p class="description">I make my research base and at the moment there are may be 7/10 of my book about human psychology according to my own researches. That will be connected not only for humans, it will be for animals too. Now I am studying psychology from different ways. It is reallity and digital. 
                    For more over time I like to find algorythms in human action, that will show for my own real understanding and do not even pretending. I really like to act something to see human reaction and analysis it for my own usage. 
                    If we are talking for real facts and object experience. First example, I was in psychosomatic hospital and was their like patient. I use NLP for making my own results, I play for roles and describe all reactions of professors in my book. I was in good position, because they think, that I am patient and they heal me. I did not think so, I study on them and write more than 1 recordbook about psychology and reactions. 
                    Second example I am good marketer and I study psychology of demand not in simple way. I have more over 10 researchings on practice, that sometimes will heard like something crazy. For example: I stay near Metro station, dance, sing, in official costume with red tie and red hat. I used it to make reaction map, how people reacts on color, sound and movings.
                    Third example I think the most strange, that I have. I try to describe how much distance human need to feel another human. For last time I started finding relations contact that people cannot hear see or control. I think that it may be only in short-closed environment. Now I cannot understand something because sometimes it is not end. I am on way to understand it.</p>
