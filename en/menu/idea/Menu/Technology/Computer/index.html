			<p class="start-text">In this concept, I rewatch computer {from zero block}. I start making it really in new way in all that we known before from simple connectors to computer block. I do not understand why humans did not it before.
			</p> 
			<p class="text">
		 		We have small processor for 30 years. We need to change structure to make her more efficient.<br> 
				I think like this only because I think that computers has stopped in “evolution”. <br>
				Yes. We have quantum processing but it is another direction, that cannot complicated at the moment with other realities. <br>
				If we want to place quantum power in every home, we need to come to it from different, strange methods. I create small prototype that may show in process of realization, how to combine quantum computers and personal computers.<br>
				I really believe in this project, I see in it something really new. I watch on practice with people and everyone said that it could not be in real. I think it was really great concept.<br>
				I make every part plan. It is really big and hard work of course. I need to talk with other people that do something similar before. I make plan and scheme for 10 parts of my new computer. I create it only on paper because I really like handwriting it is helpful to create something new now.<br>
				I believe and little scared for result. I think that knowledge that humans may create not simple different products in front end and some characteristics -> it will be really different anytime. We may use technologies from past but in new way. <br>
				I create circle-form computer that have perfect place for cooler and processor. I see this similarity from space.
				There are, I think, perfect symbiosis of video-card and processor.  <br>
				If it comes in real it may be better than all we had before.<br>
				I think that it will be high cost project. It will need a lot of researching with base that had been before.
				Here all parts needs to be created from zero and many different parts needs to be checked unbelievable amount of times. 
				It needs new operation system because no one could not use this before. It will be new from start.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="value">	
				Cost of this project really shocked for my calculating, it will be <br>
				Cost: 85 000 000  to 1 400 000 000 $. <br>
				If we try to calculate, time I could not said it finally but I need do it because it is my project and every idea needs to have my value/time comment. I think there are 470 – 910 weeks<br>

			</p>
			<p class="number">
				In result connected, to my predictions and calculating to human bad,
				Prediction -3%; +47%.<br>
				Here value equal to 82 200 000 – 2 058 000 000.<br>
				Here the project may be, and it will be few processes of all life of project.

			</p>
			<p class="text-end">
				I believe that for start of prototyping it will be fewer. But I cannot start business from it.
