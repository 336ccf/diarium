			<p class="start-text">I cannot show plan or scheme of this concept in full. In real I cannot patent it because I have no money.</p> 	
			<p class="text">It will be new technologies, which give you possibilities to live in autonomic automobile. It will be really smart car, where you will sleep when you drive to home or work. One of the best possibilities of this car will be state of sleep, it would be better, than you could sleep at home. Of course government needs to create new law for this automobile and AIDrive needs to come level 5. Car will give you safety and safe construction that had no possibilities to make bad for owner. This car will be like big capsule that safe you anyway.<br>I made design and small plan for technique equipment. Some of AI code and methods of analysis. I think for concept it was more valuable. I knew target clients already, that will start from very rich people and after I want to make in real for everyone.<br>Money for creating complete from several points, that I watched. </p>
			<p class="text">The most expensive in this concept of course mechanic and programming. Because for creating good product for market I must do all perfectly.(I cannot say that I know a lot about creating ideal, but I may said that I study very fast and have really critical mind in all that part of me)<br>I cannot say how much does it cost and how long it will be to create. I said that I must do it before 2044 was.</p>
			<p class="value">	For my 18 years thinking It will be from: </p>
			<p class="number">
			Cost = 12 000 000 - 96 000 000 $<br>
			Time = 93 – 475 weeks of work.
			</p>
			<p class="value">
			I think that I need to come this dream step-by-step.<br>
			I might start from AI and different accessories that I may sold in different directions.
			</p>
			<p class="value">
			All my predictions must to be wrong for 30-40% (Human cannot know future).
			</p>
			<p class="number">
			Cost ~ 40 000 000 - 240 000 000 $<br>
			Time ~ 121 – 665 weeks of work.

			If someone want to make money from it or give investment. I will show this entire concept face-to-face.</p>
