		 		This project combine of eagle and peregrine falcon. I want to see in human things nature because evolution more other than every human moment-thought. I want to make something, that similar with nature.<br>
<br>
				I create some of mechanism that may be similar with real animal, but it is only conceptual idea and I need to test it on practice with some items. Here may be some of new aspects like action in wings. <br>
				I want to make them more similar with reality. I am watching to the best materials to create adaptive revetment of an aircraft {I see in Net information about Massachusetts researching, but I cannot find official document to study it}. <br>
				I start my own researching about bird wings. Birds wave wings and I would not want to stop thinking about it. I want to find this result and try to combine it with simple aircraft. It is interesting thing because we will not use some kind of fuel by it.<br>
<br>
				May be wind power that could generate power by waving of different parts of wings. At the start of concept, I watch to three parts in one wing.<br>
<br>
				I want to make some beautiful skin of plane because aerodynamics have sense in design. I watch to the fastest planes that human have done before.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="value">	
				I could not imagine how much might it cost. <br>
				I want to make small prototype to make practice on it and this may be 50 000 – 620 000 $.<br>
				I did not it before and I cannot do better calculations at this moment but I may calculate hours, materials and technical process. <br>
				I think that for small prototype I need about 63 weeks.

			</p>
			<p class="number">
				My intuition think that it will be:<br>
				Cost: 65 000 – 868 000 $<br>
				Time: 80-100 weeks
			</p>
			<p class="text-end">
				It is interest at least, I think bird's evolution know more about flying.
