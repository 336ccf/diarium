			<p>I try to list main parts of idea:</p>
			<ul class="right">
				<li>You must not see difference between paper and tablet!</li>
				<li>You cannot use tablet as waste time product, it was material and instrument in first place.</li>
				<li>You may take it everywhere and every time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Why it better and help us?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We save trees!</li>
				<li>We upgrade human</li>
				<li>We do something useful and change psychology</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is my thought about this product</p>

			<p class="start-text">Tablet needs to be instrument and material for doing. Apple Inc. I wish to talk with you if you read it, because you have this patent already. It change game I think, but you need person that Steve Jobs wanted to be like... V aDoreiPreSiD L

		 		Tablet is kind of small recorder or something similar with small computer. I think that tablet needs to be small and useful. There are kind of smart book or record book. We need to use tablet by fingers. I want to add possibilities to write by hand on first plan. That could help for every art person.<br>
				Here may be similarity with instrument and material to do something like papyrus. Now I try to create working technique of connection between two batteries that needs to be in symbiosis, that make work of all tablet together.<br>
				This tablet needs to be really simple for client and complex for realization.<br>
				I think this is start from simple text redactor for my own. I will create it by myself and try to upgrade. I think I start from simple text and graphic redactor. I really want to make it from start.<br>
				I think that this project may be in compilation with phone project, but I do not see similarity in these products anyway. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="number">
				Predictions:<br>
				Cost: 45 000 – 7 050 000 $<br>
				Time: 50 – 140 weeks
			</p>
			<p class="number">
				Predictions of human bad:<br>
				Cost: 58 500 – 1 240 000 $<br>
				Time: 65 – 196 weeks.
			</p>
			<p class="text-end">
				Here the most expensive and longest is compilation of batteries, work of bold* screen. <br>
				I may show this project because I see this product in American patent office. I do it before by my mind and see patent only after creating this idea. Apple you doing good ideas in this way :)<br>
				P.S. But I make more,,,
