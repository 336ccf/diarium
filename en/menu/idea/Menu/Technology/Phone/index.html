			<p class="start-text">I want to make smart-sense reality. Now we have only phones like their own digital environment. I wanted to combine real and digital to make owner more efficient.
			</p> 
			<p class="text">
		 		Owners will have a lot of possibilities to know more about them, phone make sense that will be connected with my future internet platforms (There are OS, SocNet, WebShop, NG).<br>
				I wanted to make phones more protected from other on mechanic and network level. This need to be in our future world because all of us needs to know about yourself more than others. (I think that we will see many protests by people, that needs to have confidential in 2030-2050)<br>
				Phone now is part of everyone life and I want to make it better. Only “more” because I may calculate this to show for clients. They need to understand different to buy something new.<br>
				I want to remove zombie users and create homo deus from simple gadget. I think that everyone need to have small, comfortable and useful gadget, that create from You something more.<br>
				Often in phone we cannot create different between targets for your own or we have few time to use it without charging. I solve this problem because think in another way.<br>
				I really like paper and something like material things. Now I thinking about different ways to make phone more material not like a constant product.<br>
				I could not show a plan of these, cause of ©. I want to make it step-by-step from camera to full gadget. I need to study processes in matrix algorithms and different specific of AI and camera comparing.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="number">
				My average predictions for these project is<br>
				Cost = 50 000 to 2 000 000 $. <br>
				Time = 47 to 210 weeks
			</p>
			<p class="number">
				Also plus 30-40% for human bad predictions. It will be<br> 
				Cost = 65 000 – 3 300 000 $.<br>
				Time = 61 – 294 weeks
			</p>
			<p class="text-end">
				Here the most expensive technologies is twisted screen, artificial intelligence of camera, placing of technique and power transferring.
				I said that I do it before 2034 year. Is coming
