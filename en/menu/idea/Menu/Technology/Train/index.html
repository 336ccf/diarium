		 		Now I working for system of transporting I really think about small magnet rails that may be in tunnel. I think this will be high cost project, but I think that I may find some better ways to realize.<br>

				I like type of underground transporting. I do not like metro’s environment when you come from one to one station.<br>
				I really want to make transport underground. Seat to wagon we need on ground and transport only underground.<br>
				My thought about it - we need to remove all modes of transport except one.
				It will be cheaper and more comfortable.<br>
				I do not think that we need a lot of society transporting types. I want to have one the best.<br>

				It is hard to create fast but it will be new stage of being when it is - big city.<br>

				I want to make rounded forms and enter at back side, exit at front side. I want to make it like future transport that drives without driver. It will be really hard to create but it will be cheaper in the result.<br>

				I think this is the future and time by time we are coming for it. Now I could not think about it like commercial target but in future. Where I have money from other projects I want to make cities and countries better.<br>

			</p>
			<p class="number">	
				For my stupid calculating it may be from<br> 
				Cost: 100 000 – 10 000 000 $<br>
				Time, may be from 5 to 23 year 
			</p>
			<p class="number">
				Chance of human wrong. <br>
				Cost: 130 000 000 – 1 400 000 000 $ <br>
				Time: 6,3 – 31,2 year.
			</p>
			<p class="text-end">
				We need to build roads and tunnels for these projects. All of these need to have government acceptation. The most part of these will be safety because I did not think about critic situation that may be any way.<br>
				I create design and concept full of modern and comfort type. <br>
				This project may be commercial because PR in design connected, that may show for other something great in products or show message for society.  <br>
				I did not see many small aspects. <br>
				I need a lot of work about this concept at the moment.
