		 		I copy this to minimum air resistance to make possibilities to maximum speed and maneuverability. I do not think about motor and engine because I have two thoughts about it. <br>
				Firstly, it may be on renewable energy. Second, it may be on simple electricity. Third, that I imagine may be true and I believe it, transporting on magnetism.<br>

				I think about conceptual design that may be helpful and useful in most of all.<br>

				Now I want to compare different types of modern design and nature evolution.<br>

				My predictions for these projects. It may start after my automobile and work with AI. I think and predict, that cars come to automatic driving and most of racers comes to motorcycles.<br>

				I really think about safety of owner and about speed. I think it is the most valuable characteristics for this extremal type of driving.

			</p>
			<p class="value">	
				There are big different and I cannot think about how much does it cost. It may be<br> Cost: 100 000 – 10 000 000 $<br>
				Time: 1 to 5 years.
			</p>
			<p class="number">
				Predictions of human bad:<br>
				Cost: 540 000 – 95 000 000 $<br>
				Time: 2 to 5,5 years.

				It is predictions for real starting manufactory, build technical way of creating and many failures in process of prototyping. It is only if we have experience with transport creating.
