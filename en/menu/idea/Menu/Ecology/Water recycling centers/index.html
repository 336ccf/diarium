		 		For this all humans need to make attention between earth and nature. This is a project that really may change possibilities to live there. I wonder to place it there and show for other because some kind of ecology anytime needs equal resonance. Cause of it – big companies that make money on making earth worse. <br>
				My project constantly starts from ocean. It’s because most problems that we need to change – ocean. Ocean is life and here we need to be together. There is may be big troubles with any kind of animals.<br>
				My project is stations on water with D=12 m and 3,6 upper water. 8,4 under water.<br>
				I have plan and scheme of all methods from absorption to filtration. We need to make ocean clean. We need to start from this moment because after it will be very late. There is 3 pumps that need to clean water and condense air around. After cleaning water AI needs to check products, that will be in water. Special water ship-robots come to station and take rubbish away from connecting to the station. It may collect fish too, from AI that may sort them for class and kind. Water needs to be clean and air needs to have about 50-80 % water in composition. I wonder to make correcting the weather and making stabile control to ocean from this station. This project may help all world; he may work on hydro or solar system. My target to make it in real because I want to have children, but before I need to save world, only after it I will have children. I don’t know how long it is, and if I can’t do it I will live alone and try to safe all world. <br>
				My idea to make humans great in all ways. I want to do all for earth and make ecology projects without commercial benefit. It’s more than commercial, It’s living benefit. <br>

			<p class="number">
				I think 1 station may cost from 300 000 – 500 000 at start, after it may cost near 100 000. 
				Do it in first time we can for 39-47 weeks and after it will be faster 
			</p>
			<p class="text-end">
				I try to add scheme and plan of these and every station needs to be on 3 km distance around others.
