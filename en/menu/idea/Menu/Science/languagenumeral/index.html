			<p class="start-text">I think that human needs to create something new always. Whenever numbers and language, we may change it. It gives us possibilities to think more.

		 		I think many people in childhood create their language with friends. It is will be simple game but why we do it. It is nice way to self-realization. I know that in some countries you may create your own church and create culture. It is great and it do us better.<br>
				My idea is not to have money or make something better than it could be. It is studying and creating, I try to live like small child because they have every time positive thinking and in the main – a lot of curiosity.<br>
				I create about five numeral systems for different doings and use it all the time. This is not a perfect one, they all connected to sense, that coming from Maia, Egypt, Aztecs, Greek, Rome, China and a lot of more that I study and research.<br>
				I contain this knowledge and make from them something new. I try not to copy something, I try to find and collect meaning. 
				The last numeral system is circles. It is 12 types of circles. Circle without something – zero. After they similar to o’clock. If number 1 there are dot in place where 1 at o’clock.<br>
				It is not all; I make from it different in plus, minus, divide and multiply. There are no sign, its place regard another symbol. If you want to make minus number – dot in the circle; you want make plus, dot abroad circle; multiply is circle in circle; divide is circle separated another circle.<br>
				I in a point of view Jaques Fresco about languages. It is great to talk like melody and sing to said something. I think that it is too difficult to talk every time.<br>
				At all, I think that I cannot do it and propagate it. If someone want to learn it, I said and I really be happy if someone see from my point of view. Nevertheless, I do not understand this kind of marketing, where you come everywhere and try to recruit someone. If someone want to know I said, if do not want I talk about something more interesting to person.

				I wish that someone see it and find this enthusiastic. It is only my curiousity stream.
