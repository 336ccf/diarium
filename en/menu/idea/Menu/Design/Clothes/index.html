				There are a few investments needed. My predictions, that I need only 1 000 – 10 000 $. I do plan of this type of company at 16 years old and I think that here may be only materials and marketing at first time. At more, I need to make view of this collection. Only about 30% of all money comes to material; 10% to environment and knowledge; 50% marketing; 10% may be salary for workers.<br>
				I do it by myself and all first workers will be models. Time for create first sale may be about 12 – 20 weeks.
