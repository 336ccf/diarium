			<p class="start-text">This is idea that we had already. I want to make furniture in first for myself. 
			</p> 
			<p class="text">
		 		Every table – small work place that useful for owner. I want make it for everyone.<br>
				Table for me will be great thing that I use for my own environment. I want make it better and smarter.<br>
				I think that demand is on. That nice place for being like small design business, it is some kind of good practice.<br>
				I have about 30 different upgrades in notes for different furniture and I want to make in real all of it.<br>
				I have a lot of practice in work with materials and I like it, I want to have practice in it more than I have now.<br>
				A deal completely compare with table. I think there are mixture and combining handmade chair with handmade table. There are different special functions that I think extremely needed to be in this product. Table needs to be useful and smart; chair needs to be comfortable and flexible.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				May be this business might work only 3 months and I will sell it with benefit but I have after all good experience from this discipline.<br>

				My task in chairs is make something anatomy-based and make simple design from few parts. I want to make chair that will be smarter in adaptability that may contain work task and psychology of using.

			</p>
			<p class="value">	
				There are may be cost to 200-500 $ per one product only because it will be hard to create from steel. I want to make benefit more in experience than money. Money may help me do it again.<br>

				For first several products I may spend about 3 weeks to create 1 chair because there are different works with iron. This is only combining with business from tables. Cause it is combine products. There are also around 1000 to 5000 $ to start it.<br>

				At the result of chance 1200 to 6100 may be. And about 21-24 days to do 1 chair.

 
			</p>
			<p class="value">
				My calculations equal for 5 000 $ to start business for first 12 weeks. After it may be about 100-500 $ for 2 or 3 products. Find first clients about 100-500 $. For one product spend about 1 week and after faster because you may create your own hints or patterns.<br>
				I think that first sale may be around 6-8 weeks.<br>

				If we may calculate some chance it is may be equally to 8 000 – 12 000 $ to full start. First good sale may after 10th week.
			</p>
			<p class="text-end">
				There are some upper collection by this business, because from it I may start a lot of else like IT or Design. Because it is a full production room for everything.
