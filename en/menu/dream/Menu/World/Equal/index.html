			<p class="text">So it’s popular thing that in real can’t be at the moment. All personalities different in the beginning and if we want to said that we are equal. We need to have equal rights at start of all. 
				People can’t to be equal. People can’t to be more or less. People may have equal possibilities and opportunities. It’s may be only if they live in one right environment.
				I wonder to see world government that may give for everybody and everyone equal. Equal money, equal rights, equal attentions and all of other. 
				</p>
			<p class="text">Life may be equal for everyone and it’s will be great. I can’t understand in real for what treaty it’s may be. But I want to do it. I want to make possibilities and opportunities that people have – equal. Without race, gender, name and something idiot separated characteristics. Of course we all different from all part, something may from race, gender or name/surname, but we need to have all equal in rights. 
				<br>To be part not a country, not a city, but a whole planet. For start…
				</p>
			<p class="text">P.S. About some of fanatic freedom. Like racism, feminism, gender positions and a lot of different fight for right. </p>
			<p class="text">I can’t say that I like it, I can’t say that I dislike it. For absolute I understand why it is and it’s really good. We have a great source of fanatic fight for right. That may change something only after long concession of all humans for long years. It’s like changing that we need to have.
				In present moment I can’t said that it’s good, because it’s only start and now it’s may be really fanatic. You may lose all after one word, it’s funny. I don’t want to be in it, but it’s only in present moment. 
				</p>
			<p class="text">I think that future will be great from this “fights”. We may see the same like all humans have equal, not from government and not from others. It’s more than all that can do structures. We have free in mind, that may show us all of possibilities about be human. We may see a lot of beauty and difference in personality after all.</p>
