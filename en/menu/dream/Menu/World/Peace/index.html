			<p class="text">I want to discuss about it here and of course it’s my dream to be. </p>
			<p class="text">I think that humans more when wars and something similar with it. I want to make in real peace treaty, that can’t be something like “You can’t attack someone from this treaty”. This needs to be “Remove armament of the country”. Of course this is crazy and all people said “we are not idiots we attack us after it”. But I think we need to find equal. </p>
			<p class="text">It’s may be treaty only if all countries accept it. It’s may be full equaling value of another military to country. It’s may be creating all world free army, that will be the best cooperation of all countries of treaty. </p>
			<p class="text">I think that third variant is the best and the most interesting upgrade from this treaty is defense from space. I know about asteroids and some rubbish from space. Someone needs to defend us to save the humanity. </p>
			<p class="text">I really see it like my dream – to make peace in world. Don’t spend a lot of money to show who have the biggest ****. Don’t spend money for war and exchange it one to another making specious things upper than military. </p>
