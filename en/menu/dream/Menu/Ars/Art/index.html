			<p class="text">My target not to sale or work for other in art. I want to do it for me and my soul. I want to make thoughts and feelings in my works. My target in art make it smarter and create new hints to draw. Create your own meaning and technique. 
				I really like drawing and writing like hobby. My own structure may be to young. So I work for it and try to make it better step-by-step. 
				</p>
			<p class="text">I want to draw on building, it’s my dream I think. I really want to draw an big art on wall 4x5 meters and I really find materials and instruments in 2017 year but I haven’t enough money for it at this moment. </p>
			<p class="text">My life is full of art but I really think that I need to combine and upgrade all-around of my skills. I don’t think that I may do something really better in the skills than others. But I may do with a lot of own methods and meanings. Painting may be better not because it’s better in process of drawing it’s better in smart way or in soul thought, </p>
			<p class="text">I may contain in my art all science and history and all religious. This combining make me crazy in moment of writing some new art. 
				My the most important dream in art. Make all kinds of art. Music, sculpture, writing, drawing and a lot of more. I really want to try all that human create before. Of course I’m programmer and I may said that the code structure is more than art. Of course I human and I may said that all things that human do is art too. 
				</p>
			<p class="text">But I want to find more interesting and in the result of all, I want make something myself. Not a simple work. I want to create new kind and type of work.  </p>
