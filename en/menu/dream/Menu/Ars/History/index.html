I want to know about how people draw, like Malevich, Van Gog and a lot of more. I want to study their thinking and mind from psycho analysis their manuscripts.  </p>
			<p class="text">My dream is to see drawings from Leonardo, like Mona Lisa in real. </p>
			<p class="text">I want to see some of lost languages and lost ancient buildings. See from what them start and how it growth. I want to study and learn ancient living canonic. Like Rome, Greek, Maia, Egypt, Aztec and all-around. </p>

			<p class="text">I want to learn ars not in school or university. I want to see the best of the best workers and make my own research base. That I will use for my works in future. I may see the letter and understand sacral meaning that may don’t know the author of these letter because he don’t think about it.  </p>
