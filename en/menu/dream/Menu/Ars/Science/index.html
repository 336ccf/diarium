			<p class="text">I want to make researching of things that we study before. I have a small base of knowledge and I may think without any borders. I start to work about thousand task – Navier Stokes. I want to solve this task and use it in business. </p>
			<p class="text">I really think about science like something that we create for create something more. But it’s only thoughts and I really want to study science practically in most part of all. I want to study space and try to combine neuron physics and Artificial Intelligence. </p>
			<p class="text">I want to make future from nothing. From start and show other the ways that we can’t see under the walls that build from other science workers. 
				I want to write more theories and prove that I already start.
				My science may be really amazing and I want build business on science and art. 
				</p>
			<p class="text">I always combine art and science because it’s better together. I really can’t seen what I may do for science because I have really strange vision of all science doings. I really can’t see value of most research bases. But I try to do it and sometimes I really read interesting research from USA, Great Britain and Germany.</p>
			<p class="text">Science for me like passion from young years and I have dream to change way of study and make breakthrough in all disciplines that I’m interested. </p>
