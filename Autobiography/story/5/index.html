				1.	Computer<br>

				In this year I spent time on computer in different ways. I created content. I created hacking tools and some of hardware development. I used it to set up my plates and created something specious. I spent a lot of time for my own practicing in different types of programming. 
				I played Dota and CS GO, sometimes played Mount&Blade, Spore, Civilization, Capitalism II. My best interest of games have been spore and civilization, during all my life.
				The most important for me in work is unknown subject.
				I really did not like to do what I knew very. So it was one of the main reason why I really liked to use hacking in my study process. I did not think that I am bad person after it. It was simple curiosity every time. 
				Sometimes I sent unknown e-mails to different corporations and companies, that their site had problems.
				
				The main way to be understood is to use simple code structure. This was target that I had in all my works. I really liked simple in complex and complex in simple to found the medium value.
				
				Computer games in this moment could not gave me money because it was so boring for me.
				
				Computer started to be the most significant part of my study process, because I knew how to find valuable and useful information. This was my main interest in that part of life.
				
				I also worked for some games to their updates. This works I found on big platform for freelance.
				
				This year I started to change my way of thinking to self-studying and self-thinking. Computer in my life was almost way to earn money and study.
				<br>
				2.	Girls<br>
				
				The first time in my life, I started think about girls and relationship. I created a lot of failures in my life relations.
				
				16 years old I started from girls and it was from school.
				I came introductory lesson in new school and seated with my friend Ivan. We seat at the end center of class.
				We came after beginning and less 5 minutes from lesson.
				
				I was seating and joking with Ivan. This was annoying and no one from classmates did not interest us.
				
				To the classroom came girl - Anastasia Morozova and this was start of the story. She entered graciously and with head up. We seated with Ivan and said that she was really beautiful. I liked this and I tried to understand her beauty. She looked to us and smiled. She had straight, right walk. Beautiful cute face with nice make up. Long blonde-haired and green-blue eyes girl. She dressed to the black jacket and with pretty bag from Louis Vuitton. She seated to the left side.
				 
				After came to classroom girl – Elizabeth Zherebtsova. This girl came with great emotions full of happiness and energy. She watched around and seated to the right side. She found words to talk very fast and started it from the joke. I gave nickname - lick Elisabeth. She was with long brunet hair, brown eyes and with minimum make-up. I really interested in her too.
				
				After all, I said to Ivan that the Anastasia will be my girlfriend and Elizabeth will be my best friend. I said it quite to the ear and this was coming to real steps by steps.  
				
				All this year I spent mostly time with them.
				<br>
				3.	Business<br>
				
				In that year my business was full of engineering and chemistry.
				Of course with programming that I used every time.
				
				My engineering facilities was repairing computers, phones and other technique. 
				Chemistry was consultation and creating. 
				
				Some of plates I created by myself. Alarm clock, turners or chargers etc. I spent a lot of time to create something new that I was interested.
				<br>
				4.	School<br>
				
				School in this year was the last of my interest. I did all for relations with my girls and all for my science and business.
				
				I did not pretend that I wanted to study. I came to school only for C grades. I studied more abroad school and came to school only for end it.
				
				I had interesting teachers for literature and mathematic. I was interested in physics, but it was our class teacher.
				
				We had so much fun and jokes with Aelita Andreevna – teacher of mathematic.
				Strong discipline on Elizabeth Yurievna’s lessons of literature. 
				Lessons of physics we had much loyalty and possibilities.
				
				In this year I less about 50% of all school time.
				
				We came to Russian Army base from school and this was annoying. I really did not want to be here after.  
				<br>
				5.	Family<br>
				
				In this year I ended talk with father absolutely. I did not need and want it to do. One of my last talking gave me scar on back of neck.
				
				I spoke only with brother and sister.
				
				My family stopped think about me. Sometimes they had more interest than they needed to have. This mostly had bad result.
				
				I did not spend time in this year for my family and I did not need it. I had first relationship for this moment, I think it was the main reason.
				<br>
				6.	Passion<br>
				
				Passion at this moment was emotions and I really liked it. I did not know it before in my life.
				
				Passion in person was Anastasia Morozova. I really spent a lot of time with her. We met in school and after talk a lot. We talk when she studied in British school and a lot of time after.
				When she travelled around earth. We had chatted in WhatsApp for 12 months.
				
				I had many good stories that I remember with her.
				
				She was very nervous and bitchy. I did not think that she loved me, it was simple passion.
				I did not want to think that I am mazahist. Might be I do not like simplicity; I need something complex in relationship.
				
				One of big failure story it was story when I saw her with another guy.
				
				I seated with her and my friends in hookah place and we had fun in talk. 
				She was very bored because they were couple, but she liked to party. It was not party, it was first time when we seated couple to couple. 
				She went out, and walked away. I seated about several minutes with my friends. 
				And walked away, I think that I needed to make surprise for her. I wanted to do it; I bought some flowers and drove to her home. I was near her home faster when she came. I waited her about 2 hours and after I saw, that she was with another guy walked on the street to her home. 
				I had some tears on eyes automatically. After it for my bad I had small stationery knife and I took it from bag; I was coming to them. 
				When she saw me, she wanted to walk back. 
				I came to them and said that I needed to talk with Anastasia. Her friends said that she could not talk and did not want it. I showed them small knife from sleeve and they jumped away. 
				Anastasia tried to talk with me about 5 minutes and said that I need to give to her knife. I gave it of course and she dropped it out. 
				Her stepmother went from home and took her. I stayed with this group of friends and talk loudly. 
				I shouted near the MMA boxer; Chest to chest and after it we ended all diplomatically. 
				In the result, we drove together with guy that walked hand by hand with my girl. Also we had business after it with that guy. 
				
				Next story was illegal and I said prefer that all what I wrote after – false. Anastasia needed warm and some psycho in relationship. 
				I made this environment to her. I rent a flat and bought some products to it. 
				I came to BurgerKing and bought LSD. (in BurgerKing every time seating junkies and some of them sell it)
				I find out seller in burger king, that I did not know before and he sold it. I met with Anastasia and we drove to the flat. 
				We had a lot of passion and tried to use LSD. We waited about 1 hour and she tried to make me make up. After we turned off TV and I did not remember next 5 hours. 
				At 9 o'clock I had back to normal thinking and understood, that if I did not give back Anastasia to 10 PM to her home; her father was very anger to me. 
				Anastasia was in strange state and did not understand what was happening. 
				I took her and flat keys. Asked driver and I gave her back after 10 o'clock.
				I could not pay to the driver because I lost my purse. 
				I took his card number and send money after. He understood that I was in different mind and gave me possibilities. 
				After I walked to the metro and Anastasia’s stepmother called me. She screamed - “What You do with Anastasia”. This was very strange because I gave her back and I could not talk in this state. She did not understand it and simply scream.
				
				Next story will be in 17 years because in 16 years we did not talk more, but one story may be.
				I came from village and gave Anastasia possibilities to live with me. Because she ran away from her  home. Every day I told with her and bought a lot of fruits from Prisma. She was bored and wanted to party. I could not want to party at this moment. 
				She made a big hysteria after 1 week and left me.
				When she packed a suitcase and went out, she said that she have a delay in menstrual cycle. 
				I did not understand it because, we had not something for that moment. She was very bitchy in that accident. After it we did not talk any more.
				<br>
				7.	Creating<br>
				
				In this year I created a lot of things at home. I made product from all that I had in my room.
				I made small car with my friend and his uncle. We created a car 1,8 meters length and 1 meter of width.
				<br>
				8.	Art<br>
				
				My art in this year was better and I really wanted to make it better. 
				I made my first painting by oil and end first two recordbooks of paintings. I wrote about 30 lyrics.
				<br>
				9.	Science<br>
				
				My science in this year came to different ways, but I thought that the most valuable was Love.
				Almost in science I had been interested in all kinds of mythology. Egypt,Greek,Roman,Norway,China,Maya, Aztecs and some more. 
				I studied ancient languages try to understand it. I started learn Jurisprudence, Digital Security, Economy, Literature, English, Physics, Maths and some more.
				<br>
				10.	Sport<br>
				
				I started run in city to come somewhere. It was really useful to save time and had great health.
				<br>
				11.	Work<br>
				
				I work in this year. I tried to be call manager, reseller, b2b product manager and of course freelance. I tried and work somewhere for 1-2 days.
				
				I have my moral forms that I would not to do. 
				No chances could full up my ambitions. In all ways I did not see in chief smart person. 
				They may talk beautifully but useless and about nothing in more ways. They did not know what they talk in all-around.
