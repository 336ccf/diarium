				1.	Computer<br>

				I had my first own computer at 7-8 years in 2007 year. I found my interest and I liked technology.
				
				First that I did on computer; I drove in internet, played and watched.
				First social network was Vkontakte and e-mail.
				First games that I played were: Age Of Mythology, Swords & Sandals 2, Heroes of might and magic 3.
				I played different games in internet for the first time. I bought some game CD’s.
				My uncle showed for me Counter Strike, my friend from village Vetalik showed for me Heroes of Might &Magic.
				I started programming on simple languages already at 9 years. Understood simple code rules for different systems.
				
				Games that I really liked at 10 years were Spore, Civilization, Counter Strike, Sims and battlefield.
				
				In addition, I started to use the Pascal and wrote small programmes in the Excel. I used all of opportunities of the Windows. I watched all of computer possibilities and understood it very fast.
				
				At 11 years old, I started programming on the codes like Html, Css & C++. Using in my additional knowledge teacher’s lessons from school. By this way I upgrade my own skills that grown up day by day. One of games that I tried to understand and played was the “Capitalism”. It was hard economical simulator. Moreover, I liked to play strategy and simulators. 
				  
				At 12, I first time played Minecraft. I remembered it for all my life, music, colors and of course environment at all. I have been playing several hours from first start and for the next 3 months every day. It was amazing game. I might write book of stories from Minecraft and did after times. These stories may be about past times, about fundamental of human living and reformation. No one write novels about games. At that moment, I had about 10000 messages in 3different E-mail accounts, 500-1000 accounts in internet; Ten sites for different thematic with monetization by banners. I created them with constructors, like Ucoz WP and Drupal. I wanted to create Social Network and some games often. I asked many questions to my uncle because he was a good programmer, but in most of all he did not say me something useful. 
				I started from Java and plugins for different games. I started hacking launchers and valuable programmes. Wrote some interesting games, but I did not spent a lot of time to create something from zero. (Tetris, simulators, ping-pong, once I create 10 levels game, where u need to save planet)
				I played a lot in the Minecraft. My parents had not been giving me to play enough during 9 years. I did not anger at that moment. They gave me opportunities to smart moving. For example my parents come to my room at 22 PM and 7 AM. I pretended to sleep after they checked me. I stood up and played about 2-3 hours after or before check. I may stood up at 3-4 hours and started sleep at 00-01.
				
				At 13 years old I first time played Dota 2. I am misunderstanding now, why I played. I had good results in game. Best games for 2013-2014 year were Minecraft with many plugins, Dota 2, Spore, Civilization, Mount&Blade, Battlefield. At this ages I started my own servers on the Minecraft. I created launcher and site; compared three different server and completely created them; about 50 people had been here every day. I started make money from it. 
				I probably wanted to be youtuber, but after some tries, I could not do it more. May be I dropped to internet 15 videos about strong structures and algorithms in the Minecraft from redstone, pistons, transmissions. There were tutorials. 
				I worked with Adobe Premier, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Audition. I tried to use Sony Vegas Pro. Music covered and compared like FL studio. I tried to work with many programmes after it. 
				My mother is professional photographer. I know about photographing a lot, like ISO, Aperture, Aspect Ratio, Bokeh, Depth of Field, Digital & Optical, Focus, Flash Sync and something more. 
				In programming, I started explain Java, Html, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, PHP.
				
				From 12 years, I did money from Internet often.
				<br>
				2.	School<br>
				
				In 9 years, I have been studied in 3rd class.
				Little story from middle childhood was similar with golden rush. It was about collecting cards from magazines. In Russia at 2008-2012, pupils bought magazines that had small pack with six cards. There were some categories from usual to rare etc. We were collecting cards from journals “Supercars”, “Ninja Turtles” and more. I had many cards about cars. In 9 years, I started to trade them very well (from 100 cards I made 250). In 4th grade, I had the best deal of my collection. I found the rarest card from the collection. At that moment it was card “Bugatti Veyron Supersport”, one card for all our school. I came to pupil and started talk and sell skills. So, after 5 minutes of talking and presentation I changed about 20 cards to this one. The next day his father came to me and started screaming. I did not give back card, because it was real deal.
				
				I had good results in our informatics lessons; I was always the farthest on the program between other classmates. In reality I studied more at home, abroad study process.  Every homework from 4th grade, I did in break between lessons. I could not said that it was good, but it was useful for saving time. During 5 grades, I had good results for all disciplines. 
				At 10 years, I asked - “For what we were studying?” 
				No one could not answer to it. It started to be main problem. 
				I start think about it and found my answer. The result all of it, my value of school coming to full zero.
				During 6 grades I studied and came to lessons. At 13 years I started skip my lessons with fake reasons. Usually I need to falsify records or imagine reason. I found a lot of ways to do it. (calling another man that pretended, my parents. Create health problems, they might be real, but short in time. I knew medicine and found some pharmacy at home that may did it (high temperature, rash or sounds from stomach).
				I study a lot, but school did not know about it. In school, I had been really ugly duck during 1-7 grade. All classmates felt yourself cool & wanted kid to me. Said or made me something nasty.
				One time best friends, Kate, Anastasia and Alyona that really did not like me. Created song and dropped it to social networks. It was song that humiliate me. Main text of this song was “Kudryavtsev ginger burr golliwog(freak)”. After it, all classmates started kid to me by this way. Usually I had no reaction to it.
				
				I did not remember jokes, because they had no interest.
				
				Some of them I remember.
				One story was story about how my classmates blamed everything on me. It was 6 grade, my classmates seating in toilet and eating chips. I came to toilet for my own task, but they started shout me. I came to them and they gave me chips. They had a big pocket of chips may be 3 liters. They said me – “If you want to eat more chips, drop this pack full of water from window.” I did not see big problem in it, because I was too young. I am thinking now, that it was simple curiosity or physic interest. When I came to water crane, my classmates threw pockets of ketchup and mayones in toilet. It was terrible to see, all toilet full of ketchup, mayones and other sauces. I came to window, opened and dropped it. It was my worst doing in life. Pocket fall down in 10 cm from cleaner, it was fourth floor + 3 litres of water. I think that my classmates knew it and it was their joke to me. I started think about everything. Of course, what had been in toilet was hung to me. Classmates in director cabinet wrote all to my person. After it, I had big problems in school; they put me on police record and wanted to kick me from school. Only because I had been smart and good person previously, they gave me chance to study more.
				
				In school, I went to competitions from sport always. 
				I come to astronomy, maths, physics, chemistry, history, languages, geography, informatics, logic etc.
				
				In 13 years, scholars from high grades started kidding me too. There were some boys that everytime when we meet had principle to said me nasty things. Sometimes they beat and pressed me physically. I did not said it to adults or someone who could help me, I tried to talk and find ways to solve conflict always.
				
				Mathematics was the best discipline that I really like. I was the best in the class in maths. Our teacher was the best teacher of Saint-Petersburg in 2009, 2010, 2011. It was person whom writes in newspapers. His name was Mahover Michail Sergeevich, the best point of this teacher was unsystematic studying and free mind. He was the best teacher in school and his word was one of the main in all teachers. He gave to the best scholar’s different ways to had marks. He gave the hardest tasks for logic or to the near mathematics disciplines. If u do it, he could rate a year or fourth instantly. I had been rated in fourth – twice and in year – once (A assessment). He was amazing I went to every tournament with him. He had the best politics to scholars because everyone different.
				
				Mathematics, Informatics and Physical Education the best 3 disciplines for me.
				
				Before 8th grade, I had been nard for all classmates and some of teachers.
				
				Some of story was my founding ways to did not study. One of it – I dropped out papers from recorder and changed them to full copy. Erasebal pen to erased marks or attentions. 
				Study in school for me unbelievable, uncomfortable way. 
				
				In 7th class I started think about it. I created full copy of site. When my mom came out from home. I made copy of site on her computer. I had possibilities to remote control of teachers computer, but it was not legal. I came to mother’s computer and change repository of site. Bought domain and hosting, created the same bookmark and deleted previous. About 6 months I controlled all my marks. 
				<br>
				3.	Business<br>
				
				My main business in middle childhood was internet, games and platforms. At 13 years old I started work like freelancer in programming and gaming.
				I created sites. I made marketing and create content. My maximum site visitors were in 2012 year. (It were 500-550 average persons).
				Other sites had average users - 50.
				
				My platform in the Minecraft had 3 servers. Technology, Magic and Vanilla, we did it with my friend MaxStratu. He created content and environment on servers. I created all other, like launcher, site, servers, connection etc. 
				I created really unique thing. I created all UI design and all technical moments. We took back all money, which were spend for it. Earn nothing, but it was really funny moments of my life. 5 months we turn on servers, after we find new interest. 
				
				I started sell accounts for different games on site with marginallity about 50 – 400 %.
				<br>
				4.	Friends<br>
				
				I spent a lot of time with my friend and business partner Max Stratu. We had a small business in game and interesting points of similar interest.
				At the same, I spent all time abroad Russia with Alexey Kokurenkov. I really liked to talk and played with him in real. We could find points of interest very fast.
				Yura Zhuk Egor Trachuk and Konstantin Makarov are the best friends from school. We talk, walk and have fun often in school.
				
				With Konstantin Makarov I have interesting wasting of time. We were trying to played with chemistry. We created small bombs from bottle and some medicine. We were creating reaction that reduced a lot of gas.
				
				After school, we played behind the school with classmates often on playground. There we were playing to different games. (WWE or something like hide’n’seak, catch up). I did not like WWE because all my life I did not like fighting and I did not fight in life any time. I think it was non-humanistic. I had better talk between fight or if my enemy did not want talk, I would run away.
				
				With my friend Alex when we were traveling, I imagine different games always. It was games like all games on phone now, which were not be in that time. 
				We had paper and imagination; on paper we created small towns for everyone. Our main task was find out materials and resources. We were imagining some instruments, like axe, pickaxe and shovel. We were walking around our environment and imagining that we create resources by hitting trees and stones. 
				It was mind game. We had small workers that created every second some resources. We were creating towns and imagining enemies. 
				The best play we had in 2012 year when we created about 5 m2 map from paper. 
				<br>
				5.	Rest<br>
				
				All my rest it was change of doings, because I never liked to do nothing. I often created something new.
				<br>
				6.	Family<br>
				
				My family grown up and in 2008 year I had the brother and in 2012 I had the sister. 
				Sometimes I trained with my brother by playing some sports; red with him books. I showed how to play different games and understood work of technic.
				My parents did not talk with me and I did not want to do it too. When I started lose my interest to school my parents tried to control me more. It happened badly any way. I ran away from home at 13 years. I often tried to understand my parents. It was bad idea to do. I ended my trying and started be in my mind.
				They did not understand me and thought that I was stupid. I did not want to take money from family and I count what I need to give back them always.
				A lot of my ideas and doings they were trying to critic. It was my life and I trying to live it for world but not for family. From small years, I understood that my life did not end in my flat walls. I need to change all over the world.
				<br>
				7.	Art<br>
				I made some art often. From childhood, I understood that art was the main pleasure that humans have.
				I create all by “soul” and it was not a similar with paranormal thing, for me it is my neuron system. 
				
				I created a lot of art in these ages, but I cannot show it now. I think, that all of it my practice to be better. 
				<br>
				8.	Science<br>
				I want to know something new anytime and anyway. I tried to watch around me and understood how does it works. 
				I tried to find answers in astronomy, physics and chemistry. I created some mechanisms to make my life better. I liked to create some difference that we already had. Cause all of it – breaking all walls of my mind and disagreement with all.
				
				My best friends in book’s kinds, during all my life have being encyclopedia and dictionary. I often seated and tried to remember all what I want.
				<br>
				9.	Passion<br>
				
				My best passion was computer.
				<br>
				10.	Travel<br>
				
				 We were traveling to different countries like Spain, Latvia, Belarus, Egypt and Cyprus.
				 <br>
				11.	Work<br>
				
				My first work that I had is manager in Rostelecom. I worked at the end of 13 years old and started sell service from internet and telecommunication. I worked about 1 month and understood that it was not my way. I sold good. I did it by two ways, personal by coming to flat-to-flat and by calling on phone. It was really stupid because I didn't want to work for someone. About three workers be with me and one idiot controlled us to sell more without principles. I had principles and I did not it more, I did not want it.
				It was my first official and illegal work, because they could not take boy 13 years old to company with government regalement.
				<br>
				14.	Sport<br>
				My sport for middle childhood was football, karate, volleyball, basketball, pionerball, all-around.
				
				I studied karate in special kiokushinkai academy and came to blue belt KUI8. I did not like fighting and did not it at all. I studied more defense and fundamental mind.
				
				Football I studied all middle childhood in team NEVA and Star. No one liked me on football because I was strange and I had a nickname in team Neva - bonebreaker.
				<br>
				15.	Illness<br>
				
				I had too big problems in middle childhood it was  gastritis, hernia, angina, broken bone, big injury, problems with teeth, ear problems and all types of allergy.
				
				Hernia came from one action. At 10 years I wanted to show my strength and I took a lot of bags. It was about 25 kg for one time, but my weight was 33kg. It was too enough for me and I had a hernia after it. We were trying a lot of different ways to heal it. We came to fortune tellers and different types of doctors. At the end of all we were cut out hernia in common anesthesia.
				
				Gastritwas came to me at 9 years and continued for a long time to 13 year that we came a long course of healing.
				
				Broken bone was on right wrist and I walked about 1 month at 13 years with broken bone in gypsum. It was from football. 
				
				Big injury was funny story from Spain. My friend Alex and I were trying to play with kite on the beach. There were a small wind and about 4 days to back Russia. My friend Alex running with kite on sand but I wanted to had more wind power. So I climbed to the foundation and start running back. It was amazing, because wind more powerful there. After 3 times of running I felt down to the middle of foundation, there were stairs under three meters. I felt to my knee and lye about 10 seconds without mind.
				I climbed on stairs to top and started lye on warm sand. In that moment I closed my eyes and saw white colors. When my friend saw me, he came and asked – “what's happening”. 
				I said that I felt down from 3 meters to stairs and said one more thing - “Do not said it for my mother”.
				We did not said it for someone and after 5 minutes I could walk normal. 3 hours later my leg full up a lot and everyone adult understood my bad.
				We were coming to Spanish hospital. I was walking only on stroller after it.
				
				I had many caries on all teeth and at 13 years, I had about four seal in teeth.
				
				Every year in travel, I could not swim in common swimming pool because I needed gag for ears. It was real problem and I could not swim without it because my ears very sensitive.
				
				Allergy comes to feather, nuts and me all time for bloom, wool, and citrus.
