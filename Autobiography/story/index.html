				I always positive and try give it for other.<br>
				If I have relationship I try to do all that they need.<br>
				<br>
				I think that more about me, may said - my environment. I cannot ask everyone, because most of all mates, do not want to talk with me. I have no friends now.<br>
				<br>
				"" - Annie Morozova my first and the last love. <br>
				<BR>
				My friends said about me:	<br>
				<br>
				“I remember you as a party boy. Both smart and wise, but always close to friends. You could talk on phone all night. You've helped everyone, no matter what. Were best friends and not little. And there were a lot of people who were attracted to you. I remember you as just sociable” this is message of my girlfriend from 15 y.o. Elena Andreeva<br>
				<br>
				“I may said about you, that you're the smartest, craziest most motivated person I know.” - Olga Zorina from 17-18th  year , it's my friend.<br>
				<br>
				“Early was the norm, and then have in mind how dramatically the voice “cuckoo”” - Sergei Nazarov from 2015 year, from group “kitties and zai”.<br>
				<br>
				"We were very good friends when we were in grades 10 and 11. I remember you as a talented and extraordinary guy And you helped me out more than once" - Elizabeth Zherebtsova 
				<br>
				“Laconic and purposeful” - my friend from Vasilievskii Island Roman Ginzburg. Really colorful guy.<br>
				<br>
				“You always caught the way of life. Was focused and quickly realized what was happening. Your brain worked differently, we were different and will always remain so, so I'm interested with you.” - «Bard» he ask sign him. This is my best friend from 14 to 16 we have been in groups “CoK&Q” and “Kitties and zai”<br>
				<br>
				“When I really knew Kostya is 2014/2015, he is always very kind, friendly, ready to help in any situation. Never been angry to anyone, one might even say, was naive (for the better)<br>
				We always laughed at meetings, he told different stories and did not let us be sad<br>
				But right there, they talked to him about serious things that worried him or me<br>
				He did not always lead a positive life, in his life there were things that negatively influenced him: communication with the wrong people, not those interests, not those priorities<br>
				But he still remained a man - this is the most important thing for me.<br>
				This is Kostya from 2014/2015,<br>
				My dear friend Now Kostya has changed, has changed a lot, communication has become more diffi-cult, I am generally silent about the opportunity to meet. Therefore, I won’t write anything about the current Kostya, I don’t even have the right, because I haven’t seen him for ages and I don’t know what he is like in life now.” - Yana Belova – my best friend for a long time from different groups like “CoK&Q” and “Kitties and zai” and after abroad of them It's one of few people with whom I continue relations after.”<br>
				<br>
				"Unusual casus, over-colorful, inexplicable and unrecognized genius" - said my classmate from 11th gymnasium Vladimir Vasiliev.<br>
				<br>
				"Ouch .. I have an impression of you (:: On the one hand, a normal, cheerful guy on the other side of the split is a crazy fanatic" - said my primary classmate Valeria Tkacheva.<br>
				<br>
				"Oh.
 				The guy. About whom they definitely say, has matured.
				In childhood, that gouging was with a complex character and with no childish pranks.
				But over time, added seriousness and a lot of sound ideas)<br>
				And also a very faithful friend who will definitely support<br>
				True, I really miss you from the time when you went to the anticafe" - Veronika Surova my earliest friend, that I know all my life. Our mothers was friends and grand mothers too. We have a lot of beutiful moment all our life.<br> 
				<br>
				"Phoenix" - Alexey Kokurenkov said about me.

			I always feel that I need to change world. It's not a simple feeling, it's from little years.<br>
			I always create something new because I like to do from me, like I see it and like I want to do it.<br>
			<br>
			I have a habit to disagree with something told my family. It's not a habit it's real thought, because I different between every one like they different between others.<br>
			<br>
			I often try to do the best. I can't end my pictures or paintings because I see failures and what I can do more. But I need have end in something and I do it than I feel it.<br>
			<br>
			I always watch to sign from chance.<br>
			I always watch to the numbers.<br>
			I always try to find understanding of something in new way. Because I feel that we have bad understanding.<br>
			<br>
			Sometimes I watch to the letters and try to create meaning. With new words I find new meaning. I try to separate it to parts and understand why something have line up and something have line down, something have circle something have a connection. 	<br>
