				1.	Computer<br>

				Computer in this year was my entire environment. I lived with him and studied a lot. Explained depth of languages and possibilities. Tried to compare a lot of information; understood how to find and read information.
				
				I made money in deep and trained my skills on it. It was illegal or not so normal. 
				Every order, I had politics “do not something bad personally”.
				
				I studied hardware languages. Live in computer club for 4 months. There were 2 dollars for 1 hour of computer using. 
				I used free all time. I created it by hack their operation system from USB. I used all possibilities of computer club. 
				First I made contact with all administrator and general directors. I told with them and they knew me or thought so.
				I eat little bit every time. Washing body in my friend’s house. In most of all I drank water for free there. I might drink 2-3 liters in a day. 
				Used all computers sometimes to make something hard. Might hack something hard. 
				
				I made different types of uploaders and did it very well. All the time I drove in deep web, that I knew very well. Sometimes administrators came to me and I needed to pretend that I do something stupid. I opened games and sometimes I screamed to pretend that I talk with teammates.
				
				One story from my life was the most powerful lie. I hacked very good. I had big power from all club’s computers. I hacked Lamoda, Wildberries, Moscow people bases and a lot of small sites to their clients data. Huge possibilities that I had in computing power I used for cameras, crash-tests and of course connecting to servers. The most powerful in my doings was connecting to military base that placed in Pskovsky region. I made it 2 days and watched some files.
				I did no bad. 
				I did not drop to the Internet files or said it to someone. It was simple curiosity from 17 years old person.
				My works did not know someone before.
				
				In computer club, also I hacked phones of my girlfriend and your computer. 
				Called from different places and numbers to talk with Anastasia. 
				
				In computer club I started idea of my first project. It was like Cicada and I wanted to make it bigger. I created brand of this project and start work for content. I was really perfectionist and could not end something. I was alone and I could not like what I did.
				 
				In computer club I study a lot, compared information, self-researching, waving in deep web. After my living there, I had one Tb of useful information. 
				
				Project’s that I already had started I will realize in future.
				
				This environment had end in 2019 February. 
				I went from computer club and saw many police officers. I ended all in one moment and returned to  home.
				
				Second part of 17th I study in computer only. I used only open web. Study a lot and change all-around.
				<br>
				2.	Girls<br>
				
				In this year I lost all my relationship. I had relationship only with Elizabeth Zherebtsova and Anastasia Morozova.
				
				I lived in computer club. We spoke with Elizabeth and she wanted to help me. It was not need. 
				She gave me chance to live with her family at Sestroretsk’s apartments. I had been there four times.
				I told with her; tried to help in different relationships. 
				I told with her brother and we found contact very fast. 
				I told with her father and mother good too, I really liked them. 
				They live like vegetarians and do not eat unhealthy food. 
				Every time they created good food for breakfast and did not make me something bad.
				I think that it was family system and I did not kind of it. Because I had some problems that I need to decide.
				Her father was smart human, whom boss of big pharmacy company that called “Solopharm”. 
				He did not talk a lot with his family but he did all for them. He was very good husband and father.
				Her mother understood and reasonable woman that tried to help all-around in family. Sometimes we seated at the kitchen and told about relationship of Elizabeth.
				
				The situation that I did with not valuable reason and I need to get back it for any ways. In the last day I seated in the office room and heard the music. Thought how I got back money to man who gave me a big deal. I could not do it at the moment because Elizabeth’s family took me to Sestroretk. 
				I seated in room and wanted to find some interesting books. For my bad I started open boxes in the room and found transparent folder with a lot of money. I closed it very fast and opened another to find books. I found small book and tried to read it. 
				I lied on sofa and thought about money that I needed to back for my partner. After few time I took 5 000 rub. 
				All next day and all next half of year I thought about it. I needed to get back more than money that I took there. Because I did very bad thing. They did not said me anymore but I thought about it all time. After 1 year Elizabeth said that she known about it and I could not said something. Because it had been.
				
				With Elizabeth we had different stories and they all good. But I needed to show me from worst side.
				
				I did not want to said stories that in all ways good because it is intimate stories between us.
				We had only mental connect with her. She was best friend for a long time. We wrote paintings by oil, ink and pencils. I first time played on forte piano in her home and I really liked it.
				
				In that year with Anastasia Morozova we met only 6 times and all of them were colorful. 
				First time we met in the middle of November - twice. In February – twice. In the spring – twice.
				
				First two times we met in her home. We had beautiful contact. I did not talk with her after and lost our connection. I was busy at that moment and she found another boyfriend. I did a lot of failures that change our relationship and I wanted to get back all in winter of 2017-2018 year, but it was hitting to the wall.
				First I wanted to talk with her but she blocked me in all SN. 
				I called her from 50 different numbers. Hacked her social networks and tried to hack her location but could not do it.
				All time my mind created projections that she could read my posts in SN. And 1 month I text post to invisible persons, that could not be Anastasia. I wrote poems and lyrics about my feelings.
				
				My idea – came to her flat and met her. About 2 days I came from back enter. I came and seated with her room. She lived at that moment in the hotel. I came sometimes sang and placed my poems. Place there some of my creations and tried to get back her. But it was any way bad result.
				
				This story – lie. I came to her room and took instruments. I cracked her lock by hands. I came and used hand-drill (that comes to the work by hand twirl). I made it about 5 hours from 01:00 to 06:00 I stayed full of sweat and without body wear because it was really hard. 
				I sawed out lock of the door for contour. When I opened room, she was in Dubai. I saw a lot of mess and I put all her room in order. I made order in all clothes, took out the garbage and took the present that she gave me for my birthday. It was her photo.
				I told with her father and he said that I need to make pause in relations.
				I agreed with him. But I did again after one month.
				In the 18 February, I created a ring from metal and amber to her. It was too beautiful ring that I did by myself. I came to her. She was coming to home from fitness house. I stayed on knee and said may we marry. 
				It was funny, she asked drunk I am or not. I had been sober and we told about 1 minute after.  
				
				I came to her after and tried to talk. I came 8 times. Every day from end of February and start of march 26.02 – 04.03. 
				I came and sit in the lobby of hotel at 9-11PM. When evening began hotel keepers called to the police and they took me to statement 5 times. 
				At 5th day I gave to her big sport bag full of the best valuable things for me, that I had for all time. 
				
				There were a lot of books, models of engineering, Iphones, rings, poems art, my card that I change in third class, the best of vapes and a lot of good things. But she dropped it out like trash. I could not calculate it and it was losing all what I had before. 
				After this I came to her and climbed on the sewer to third stage, where were living Anastasia. I knocked to her window and saw her with boyfriend. He came to me and we told about several minutes on high tones. 
				
				The last day was the worst of all and I came to her and got drunk. I came to hotel with stationery knife and came to the lobby. Shew them knife and said “do not call police”. I did not open it and got back to my blazer. I up to the 3rd floor and dropped out the door, that I cracked before. Door closed to the lock, but I did it with great power and it opened. She stayed second and watched. I hugged her and said “no one could not disconnect us”. We were lying on bed and she screamed with smiling.
				Came hotel keeper and disconnected us. I saw police officer in the doors and I jumped from window. I stood up and ran 500 meters. Police officer that stayed on 1st floor ran forward me and tailed me to lock. We came to the police statement and told with officers. They brang an psychologist to talk with me. He came, We spoke about 1 minute and he said that I am normal and I don't need psychosomatic hospital.
				Everyone said that I needed to have an direction. He gave me an advice to visit Behterev Psychosomatic hospital.
				
				I rent a room near Anastasia’s hostel. Window of my room shew her window and I watched to her from high place. First time I slept good.
				After It we no told and I only wrote poems about her. I thought that she need to growth and had target in life.

A lot of groups started talk about me and only 3 people tried to call me. I made special mistake where the date of document was to the next day between post date. Some of my friends foundmistake and did not worry about it. But many people thought different.

Watched to me like Jesus and wanted to talk with me. After I became to external study and went to school once in month.

Made a lot of science practice in psychology. I trained my skills on workers from psychosomatic hospital “Behterev”. I trained literature, psychology, art. I ate a lot but not a good food. I did not drink my pills everytime. I dropped it from my mouth. Drank them like David Blain with his magic tricks. Sometimes they said  “show your mouth” but pills were staying in my neck.
