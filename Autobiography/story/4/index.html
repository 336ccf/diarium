				1.	Computer<br>	

				At that moment computer also had been most part of money. I boosted accounts CSGO and Dota 2. I understood how to hack something. I tried to hack cameras and some sites at first. I did not it for something bad, only curiosity stream.
				
				At half of 15 years, I started freelancing for different platforms and tried to make real money from it. I did sites, repaired computers, created paches&programs, set up servers etc.
				
				I did not play without target. I had first team in Dota2. We came to the tournament and had 3rd place. This tournament was Starladder 3. After Starladder our team disbanned, because everyone could not waste time for it. We played with my best teammate Danil “YoYo”. I always play in middle lane and sometimes take carry. My best heroes is Invoker, Storm Spirit, Ember Spirit, Shadow Fiend, Lina, Earth Spirit, Meepo, Anti-Mage, Wind Ranger, Queen of Pain, Naga, Tinker.
				
				My best programming languages is HTML&CSS&JS&PHP&MySQL; Java; C++; Ruby; C#; Python but work with more than it. I worked with 30 different languages and sometimes I did not it before. I studied during work everytime.
				
				In the end of 15 years, I started work with hardware. I built small plates and created microchips from different details and wires.
				<br>	
				2.	Business<br>	
				
				My business at that moment was weird, but it was good way. I had some friends that used different drugs. When I came to school I sold to them something better than they may use. I sold them medicine, that give them better effect. Them stabilized their emotional system. I sold them nootropics, vitamins and something good for theirs mind and health. I made from junkie – humans. Of course I told them about bad and good possibilities every time. They changed their way often. 
				I really liked nootropics at that moment, but I controlled my results of all actions by self-researching on programmes and monitoring technique.
				
				Also I of course worked in internet and this was my business at least freelance, small agency by doing site’s. 
				<br>	
				3.	Friends<br>	
				
				At that moment best friends for me was Danil from my team in Dota 2, friends from group Community of Queens and Kings. That started from color festival and after this group COQAK. 
				I met and knew a lot of people all other Saint-Petersburg. I had about 5000 friends in social networks and wanted to have more. I was in different groups from SPB. I had about 30 group contained 50 and more people. I did not remember them all. But my best friends from all of these were Max Stratu, Yana Belova, Evgenia Titova, Anastasia Ahmetova, Daniil Firs, Alex Moiseev, Alexander Nikolenko, Danila Barianov, Viktor Solmanov, Vadim Cristall, Daniil Demchenko, Philip Philipov, Denis Nasedkin and more.
				
				I knew a lot of people and had an interesting time with them all.
				There were no money, only friendship. With this company, we were coming a lot of parties, festivals, places like hookah, anti-cafe, cinema, parks, roofs and something more.
				I had colorize life at that moment. I think it was only pretended happiness. 
				I did not kind of it, but I laughed enough at 15th year old.
				
				I think that it was peak of friendship in my life.
				<br>	
				4.	School<br>	
				
				It was 9th grade and I did not think about school. Because it was not interest for me.
				I studied to C assessments. I did not go to school in consequence of which teachers did not like me. Only class teacher could help me in any ways.
				
				I had three attention in consequence of which I kicked from gymnasium. 
				The first attention was. We were in classroom on break, teacher did not come to our class. There were 2nd floor and we might dropped out from room window to roof entrance. This was winter and in classroom was hot. I needed to heat down. I had been tired and I wanted make some fun. So I left classroom from window and started throw snow balls from street. I threw, all class laugh. Teacher came and I threw to his body. After this accident I had first attention.
				
				Second attention was about my vape interest. I came to 2nd floor's toilet where all schoolars do something wrong, because only on second floor we had no camera in toilet.
				{Sometimes we jumped from this toilet to come over from lessons}
				I started vaping in toilet and one of schoolars said it to the teacher. After this, I had second attention.
				
				Third attention was the funniest for at moment when I had been uncovered. I got drunk in school and going with small bottle of Ice Tea. Where I had fluid of cognac similar for color. I came to different classmates&have fun. So after I came to teacher of Physical Education with whom we were drunk one time and she took my bottle. Came to the director and tald all of it. I really laughed about it, because I did not understand her action at this moment and this was 3rd attention.
				
				Teachers had the council and they gave me possibilities to study for end. After it I ended studying in 11 gymnasium. I had possibilities to study more, because my class teacher spoke with others. 
				I understood, that I did not want to study and end it.
				
				After 16 years I came some times to ITMo and gave documents to study in college. But in the reason why I did not it, my marks could not give me possibilities to study for free. I would not take money from my parents.
				<br>	
				5.	Passion<br>	
				
				My passion at 15th year was socialization and fun. I had no task to do it more than others, but I had a lot of friends after this moment. May be it was false friends.
				<br>	
				6.	Family<br>	
				
				From 10 years old I had politic. That I did not take money from my parents and count what I need to get back them always. From 13 years old I never said “Give me money”. From 15 years old I started make money and did not need it more.
				
				I ran away from home every time and this was crazy. 
				
				I had not be at home a lot of time. I seated sometimes in computer and took away it.
				
				A lot of aggression that they created in me I did not said them. I hitted walls and had big problems with fist and wrist. The main aggression was from where they said to go shop. 
				They needed see my priorities and needs. This was the biggest problem all over the world, with parents and children. Parents never think about children interest.
				
				I did not said them something. I simply hit and bit walls; 5 times a day with full power. My fist in blood and I went to shop. It was being during 4 years from 2012-2016. After all in result I have a real problem with middle finger bone on right hand.
				
				I did not love or like them no more. I only understood that I needed to get back all what they give me in material way.
				<br>	
				7.	Rest<br>	
				
				A lot of different ways, but rest for me was simple socialization.
				<br>	
				8.	Creating<br>	
				
				In this year I created about 200 different projects in internet for money.
				<br>	
				9.	Art<br>	
				
				I created a different signs and paintings in books, some of lyrics and poems. I started train my dance and sing.
				<br>	
				10.	Science<br>	
				
				The main discipline of 15 year was psychology and speaking.
				Also programming and work in practice. Spending time – Management. Engineering like computer science.
				Chemistry, medicine, neuronal system and something of modeling mind.
				<br>	
				11.	Sport<br>
