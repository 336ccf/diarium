			1.Sport<br>
				From four years old, I played football because my family thought that I need it. In addition, it was because my father played football in the team and had more than 39 cups for it. He played from the early ages.
				I did not like to play football, because everyone wanted to kid me. In addition, my trainer did not see in me, professional player. Everyone said that I am stupid and had not possibilities to play.  I had been played in the second team during 2006 - 2012 year and had no possibilities to go back.
				
				More than football I like to play chess, that shows me all of the different kinds of moving. I played chess for about 2 years and had 2nd discharge.
				
				I liked swimming and studied it for 3 years. End studying in the 2009 year because swimming pool came to the renovation of their foundation. After the renovation, I could not study it because they took pupils only under 9 years. I liked swimming, but after this, I might do it only in practice.
				
				Volleyball, pionerball and basketball. I liked in primary school and had good results, but I could not play abroad school.
				
				Best sports for me was football, swimming and chess. Football I had played from 2004, swimming from 2006 to 2009. Chess from 2005 to 2008.
				<br>
				2.Courses<br>
				In my early childhood, my family gave me many different types of courses. First, I loved in the 2005 year was logical thinking. I had been studying logic for 2 years.
				I liked drawing courses, where we studied the most valuable things in art by brush and pencils.
				<br>
				3. Children garden<br>
				I went to the children garden at 2 years old. Children garden was the first place where the human studied to socialization and fundamental disciplines. I had been studying in children garden from 2002 to the 2007 year.
				I had two friends and I talk with all children diplomatically. I had no enemies, but sometimes I had differences in view with others. We had many fundamental disciplines there.
				The most interesting for me at that moment was physical education, but in real, I liked all of disciplines.
				Food that we had there was not so good, but we had once in a week cupcakes (it was the best cupcakes that I had been eating during all my life).
				We had a lot of different toys and small outside place where we walked and played.
				I had some valuable stories from children garden.
				
				The first story about how our educators related to us. When we were coming after dinner to sleep. When educators left the sleeping room. I started talking with my friends and I could not sleep after dinner, because I did not want. I did not sleep all the time always and when educators wanted to check us, I pretended that I slept.
				
				The second story was the story about my friends. I had two best friends - one girl and one boy. I liked to talk and play with the girl and all of the time we were wasting time more than others in children garden. I might say, that we had been good friends. I remember one story only. The story was about our fantasy. We were running and thinking about some mysterious and interesting. I might say that it was my first valuable story in life.
				We were running near the walls of our children garden and were watching to the basement through a metal grid. We were discussing rats that might live in the basement and trying to see them. After we were looking to space and talk about enemies-aliens, that could attack us and we needed to defend. We were imagining plasma-guns from them we were shooting to the sky.
				Second, my best friend from children garden was Danya Mahinya. With him, we were talking even after children garden. We had the secret place on the territory of children garden. It small piece of trees where we played a lot of time. I tried sometimes to eat ants, I remembered that they had sour taste.
				
				The third story really showed me. At 3 years all of the children answered the question - "What profession do you prefer?"
				All of my mates answer something like policeman, fireman, nurse, teacher and etc. I said that I will be the president.  
				I understood and remembered it only after a talk with my educator Lubov Alexandrovna. She remembered it for all time and when I met her he said it.
				<br>
				4.	School<br>
				First time I came to school in 2006 year. It was Gymnasium №11 with main discipline English. My first teacher is Marina Alexandrovna.
				My class contained at 1st stage 31 pupils. We had relations with all class, but mostly all separated to gender. My best friends in school was Yura Zhuk, Egor Trachuk and Max Stratu. I also told with Peter Senin, Nikita Samarkhanov, Vladimir Vasiliev, Mikhail Romanov, Nikita Dragunov.
				I liked disciplines in school like Mythology, Physical Education, Art, Mathematics, English.
				
				First story was the story about sport in school. My best friends with me often played football in corridor during the break. We had no possibilities to play with ball. We created gates from closed doors and balls from bottle cap. When we were in first and second grades we played with pupils from third and fourth grades.
				After playing football, we stripped floor from lines that we make by boots. We were crawling on our knees with a rubber band and were erasing all lines.
				
				Second story was story from second grade. Story started from my market. I found in market paper with stickers (it cost 10 rubles and I bought about 5 papers of stickers).  I came to school after and started my small business. I sold one sticker for 5-10 rubles (on 1 paper have been 7-8 stickers). So I sold 1 sticker with marginality 90-120%. First day my classmates gave me orders to buy stickers and I sold all stickers in first day. I started new way to sell on next day. When the teacher exit from classroom, I rotated my classtables to 90 degrees and showed all my products on table. I had more sells and my friend Max Stratu started sells with me. My classmates had some of my stickers and some of their stickers from home. On the 3rd day all class did it like me, when teacher exit. We sold more and I was the best seller of my class. I started new main stream. The end of story started on the 5th day when I sold my best deal. I sold sticker for 250 rubles, it was about 2500% marginality. On the 6th day our teacher got it and gave me attention. Teacher caused my parents to school and I may kicked out of school.
				
				Third school story about my bad and stupidness. I was anger to Max Stratu and wanted jump to him. I jumped and he moved to left. I jumped to wall. I had a hole in head and when I exit classroom. I dripped blood from my head hole to all class-tables. After these problem I went to hospital and they sewed my head like Harry Potter.
				
				I had A grades in all disciplines with only 10 – B grades for 2 years. One time I had A+, it was incredible because we had not these mark in culture.
				<br>
				5.	Friend<br>
				
				My best friends was Alexey Kokurenkov, Yura Zhuk, Egor Trachuk, Max Stratu, Danya Mahinya. Alexey Kokurenkov – family friend, we often travel to different countries. I am older than him for 1 year.
				
				We played in different games often, that created by our mind.
				
				I had some friends from village or near family. Like Vetalyk Karavashkin or Igor Dockin.
				<br>
				6.	Family<br>
				
				I had normal relationship with my family. My father did not talk with me too much because he was on work a lot of time.
				
				With mother, I had difficult relationship, but she loved me.
				
				At that moment I had grandfather, grandmother, grandgrandmother, grandgrandfather, godfather, godmother.
				
				I did not love or like my family, but I had value for them. I did not use love word for someone who did not my girlfriend.
				
				Always I had a bad behavior that thought so by my environment. I did not think so.
				
				I like talk only with grandfather and grandmother, because they had long life way and they knew how to live. I did not interested in mother and father in talk.
				
				My grandfather was amazing man, he played rugby and was Jurist. In addition it past he was in part of USSR in Geodesic work.
				
				My grandfather dead when I was 8 years old. I really like him. He was very good person. So I did not see him really often. All times when I see him I remember good and warm emotions. One story that I remembered throw all my life. How at 6 years old he took me to hands and twisted.

				In second grade, I started finding books from high school and started them. My classmate Angelika, which had books from high school, wanted to waste books for chemistry, physics and algebra from 8-9 grade. I took them and when I came to home, I spent a several hours by trying to understood them.
				
				I always ask adults. What we could do with numbers. At second grade I knew about multiply and divide. After, I started asking more and more. So, I knew about exponentiation and radical at 8-9 years.
				
				In school every year I won first place in competition for mathematics calling “Кенгуру”, I did not go to second stages in competitions, because I had not target to win. I had target to understood my qualification. I took a part of all competitions, because I interested in testing me.
