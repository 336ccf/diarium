				1.	Business<br>

				In this year I first time really prepared to make big business. 
				I work like small private agency. The most significant I started to be business person. 
				There are a lot of different reasons and the most powerful for me was humanity and earth. 
				I want to change all that we have before. I want to clear all problems and will make from minus to plus. My target to make human great again if talk like American and if talk like my heart want to talk I want to make much better all of us. Every personality need to be unique and specific for others. 
				I want to change all laws what we have and teach others how to be more that he could be.
				
				I had a different practice to create an idea and I think the most powerful is creating by understanding something new. Finding the way of new thought in all ancient thing. We have something that we use a lot of time and I want to change all of we have. I don't want to help people who around me or who know me. I want to do it for everyone because we are humans and world ends only after orbital system of earth... At the moment, but after I really prefer to work with space communications and living too. This is really amazing thing I think, because it's unknown, but I don't think like Elon, he have a nice target but Venus equal to the Mars and have some different. It's a nice target but I think first that we need to do is colonization on Moon. It's may be platform for future planets.
				I really wants to change Earth and environment, because we have a strong problems with it. We are humanity that have an rubbish at home I think no one wants to have rubbish in the bedroom or in kitchen, but it is and we need to make better living. There are a lot of different ways to make it all better and recycling centers not the best one. We all need to make community of people who want changes and make for it all. I want to leave in clean home, because home is abstract description. We may see it with maximum and home for us – Earth and after – solar system. We need to change it because we can't close eyes, we live here.
				
				So why I talk a lot of abstract unknown things? I make some of mind amusement and all of my projects running to my targets, big targets. Every project that I create of course need to have value, one of value is future, second is the past and the third one is the present. I need to make steps by steps walking to my dream. Because after it I can't have a children, it's fool from me like father to give them home like something it. I don't know how long my way is. But I want to make it in life.
				
				My first business from my small economy qualify may be in digital. Cause marginality and value. Almost reason of it – internet it's new kind of environment that take our time, and this haven't any material between electricity. I like internet because there are in all place in all world. Elon do great thing and everyone may use internet from see I think. This is amazing really. I know that it Google idea from interview with Elon Musk that written like an book, but I think that it's human idea. 
				
				{I don't like something like - “I from America””I from Great Britain” “I from Russia”
				“I from Earth” - I said. Because all of us is – humans and this is really colorful word.}
				
				My first business that I start is business from myself and only after it I have all other. You may said why you are business and I'm not? I may answer that I make statistics and forecast. I value all of I have. I may said that I only open business, because every statistic and value You may see.
				
				I always want to find ways that different from others, I make it everytime. It's really fun and great because no one have been there. I want to be first and take all failures. Because only failures give you answer from god.
				<br>
				2.	Study<br>
				
				In this year I study more than in all my life. In moment of writing this sentence I have a hiccups and this is body sign.
				I study about 36 disciplines that really different and it only in 2019 year. When I start collecting all my time with experience. This is the second part of my 18th years old. First part of my 18th I try to find work I come to 100-120 different interview for 3 months. I try a lot of different ways of work. From manager to teacher, from artist to actor, from administrator to call-center, from physic worker to jurist, from coocker to officiant, from programmer to designer, from loader to handyman, from seamstress to factory worker, from distributer to marketing manager, from photographer to model and a lot of different kinds of professions. But all of them sent me nothing at most and don't call me back. I come only for 5 works officially it's marketing manager/programmer/designer to computer club where I work before, but they threw me to the money. I work about ¾ of month, was late only 3 times and they give me salary 2000 rubles from my agreed 15000. I can't communicate with them any more.
				Before it I work in the kitchen of restaurant Brexton like helper and some cooker. I really like this place for their atmosphere. They have a nice back and front of restaurant. I like it so much. Them all have a lot of emotional contact and this is amazing. I work here about 1 week and not because they send me out. I don't like to be helper. I often said that something may be better in it or something we need to do like it. But i'm helper and no one hear me.
				After all of this I work as distributer in windows. This is idiots job, From this I start understanding people, when all of sellers try to bred them. I have been the worst seller because everytime I try to help people for free. I come from flat to flat and this is so ashamed. Everytime I talk very good and find contact because I pretend to be very modest. I try to help another ways and talk about emotions like psychologist, without idea to sell something. I come and talk. After this I try to help and only if people want to save time and buy – I sell. I make only 1 sale for 3 days it's really bad result for my living expirience, but I don't want to sell bad things, that I don't like. Sell bad without demand. I don't like it, I make all people good and give them emotions. I help 12 people for free and come to 60 peoples. About 30 don't open to me and only 1 woman buy something and I try to make it cheap as I can. Because woman is very nice. She is the teacher in ITMo and I make a nice talk with her. In last talk, when I need to close sell boss said me dissolve her to more money. I said nothing and turn off call. After it I make sell cheaper and give all money to this bad company, because I don't want to take money from them and of course steal.
				It's three material places where I work. I try to work for friends like call manager and I have a good result from 100 calls good from them is 88 and coming to meeting is ~ 50-60 companies. I don't take from it money, only experience. I do it really quickly and fast because it's my work.
				One of all my jobs is work to the agency. I work really good and try to make it better because I have an experience in this job but they have bad politic too. They want to earn money but not to really help humans. I don't kind of it. It's not my cup of tea.
				The last kind of job, that I spend a lot of time is building. I work for 5 different organizations also for LenSpecSMU to build something. In all places they don't give me all of money. It's hard to understand. First place is the roof of old house. I think this is the hardest one, because I take about 50 kg for me 50 times in 30 minutes. It's sacks of concrete for 50-60 kg. At this moment my weight may be 68 kg and this is crazy hard. I do it 5 days in a week. Sometimes I with one guy needs to lift up beam that comes to 120 – 320 kg that we need to move on the roof to 30-50 meters on the wooden small planks that is prototype of the roof. I think that I have after it hernia. But all good only 1 problem I fall down corner of beam and it felt to my finger of right leg. After it I try to clean roof, make a canopy on high of 6 floors. And I do it all, after 2 weeks they pay to me 10000 rubles. And they must to pay 15000.
				I come again to different location and there are a nasty work to make sealing of 4 high-rise building. I ruined 2 shorts and 2 pants. It's more than they pay me. I work 1 week and they pay no more than 2900 rubles. I think that it's joke but they don't think so.
				And in the end of all I come to the last work in the winter when the weather is so cold. There are may be -15 degree. I work on high-rise building and make facade on high by setting that grape to the roof. This is so cold and bad. I work 4 days and they don't pay me.
				After it I broke idea to work physically for someone.
				
				I need to say, what I find from all of it. I understood for myself, that I can't work for someone, because they don't know what I know in most of all. I know that real boss needs to be part of employer. I understood that boss needs to have a lot of knowledge and may do every work in his company may not batter and not faster, but he must know everything in his company from the beginning. Real boss need to have thought about human and client in first of all. The target of all company and corporation needs to be the humanity and being better. Every boss needs to have dream and make it real by targets&tasks. The most powerful dream win in all ways. Boss needs to be all-around. Boss needs to be psychologist in all ways. I think I may find a lot of more from my head but it's the most interesting, I think.
				
				It's only practice in my 18th years. Next part of year is theory. It's begin from 3 January 2019.
				
				I change all again I refresh all my and my environment, I clear all phones contacts, socials and a lot of more. It starts from accident in New Year. I have been closed at home during all New Year event. I cook supper and seat alone. Think about future and me. I find ways to do something new. I start being in myself and watching for future. After 2 days I create idea and start my first statistic. I start it simple I watch films and control time. After it every day I upgrade it by adding some habits. From this method of living, habits creates faster then in researches. I spend no more than 10 days to create inhabit, than in researching from America you need spend about 21 day to make new inhabit. I train me and making yourself researching from statistic. After I have an dream to study in America in MIT. I try to come it. I meet with director of organization educationusarussia. We have a nice meeting in ParkIn. After January 2019 I make statistic more smart. I do it in Excel and control them. After all of it them are start to be complex. After it I start every time write them in English. So it's great to see. A make a lot of interesting parts of statistic start to control nutriol, spending water, electricity and of course my needs.
				It's coming to be myself school that contain about 36 disciplines: Dream, English, Art, Design, Technology, Writing, Latin, Mathematics, Engineering, Science, Marketing, Informatics, Business, Physical Education, Biology, Physics, Biology, Psychology, Economy, Management, History, Jurisprudence, Sing, Dance, Music, Mythology, Society, Graphic design,Ecology, Cooking, Teaching, Anatomy, Building, Modeling, Philosophy and may be something more.
				
				I study and write down all my processes, without tests, but with creating projects. Finding ways to make it in practice to realize it.
				I come to different meeting of study abroad, this is my English speaking practice. I come to 20 meetings for 3 months and meet with more than 300 universities. Only the best I save like brochure.
				
				I come to 15 universities SPBGU, RANEPA, ITMo and a lot of others.
				This is about 34 lessons to different disciplines that we have in all of Saint-Petersburg Universities.
				I talk a lot and ask different questions, that I write before. Often they said that I speak very fast and too hard information. I try slower but nothing hear from them. I really want to have answers. I have a lot of different question on paper and there are about 500 questions. I want to ask only persons. I come to Universities and make psychosomatic tests for students. From it, I make useful researches for colors and thought of Russian students. Combine to psycho types and combine with race, color of hair, eyes and other things.
				After all, I connect to business tournament in our team, we have an girl from MBA degree. It is boring, because she is doing nothing and think that she was much smarter than we. We lose this tournament, because in the end of tournament, when we need to send it for check in. All boys work was not be added to the result presentation. There are girls think that they know more and do not add our work. We lost it and did not come to the second stage. After all, I saw the stand of this company and told with workers. We connect with them and they take my researching abroad.
				I study a lot, about 10 hours every day, sometimes all 16. But average is 12 hours a day.
				
				I come to German science conference and talk about projects. I write e-mail to different professors, but no one answer me.
				
				In the May and June I collect my science portfolio by doings attestation works for different universities. I do about 50 works and collect it from all disciplines. It's like I end a year in 20 different universities and 1,2,3 majors. I wrote all from me, I did not copy something between containing, I make sending to books and researching that human have. But all works I write by me and my mind.
				
				This is the first moment of my life where I have been interested in study because I have target and tasks. All my life I study on practice and don't do researching. Now I do it and very good for 18 years.  
				
				I do it for rule that I create by me and myself. 12 % doings = 88% result. 
				
				I write a lot and time by time, step by step. In free time I playing games like Minecraft, Dota, Cs Go.
				
				Because it's really have some mind games, reaction, imagination, free and a lot of characteristics that have every cyber gamer.
				
				I like this way and I see results of all my doings and study. I have the bigest motivation to change world.<br><br>
				3.	Creating<br>
				
				In this year I create a lot and really like it. Calculate and exchange thinking. This all similar with life structures and work of world.
				
				I make all of concepts, prototypes and start one project.
				
				Conceptual ideas that I have placed on site, I can't show and talk more. Cause I think someone may stole it make and do bad thing. I do not think about money, only my mind would make it real with great team and a lot of calculations. I don't want show all of ideas only because they may be done wrongly. I see it differently between others and in most of it I believe.
				There are 100-120 concepts. Prototype of bodyguard and earphones, also I start making furniture and instruments. Project of business from myself, that I do at the moment of writing it and I think this project will be in all my life. I do about 5 designed clothes. I make 2 portraits, 3 paintings, all by oil. Start 47 notebooks, end 5 record books. Create about 1000 Graphical images. Do about 50000 photos by phone and camera. Write about 50 lyrics. Write autobiography. Save nearly all about me from 2019. Create 1 theory about 30course work, 3 diploma work. Create 5 sites. Create 3 programmes. Create nearly plan for 3 years and have plans for 50 years. Write 1000-1200 list of papers. Make about 100 researches about humans and also me.
				
				Run nearly 300-500 kilometers, it's about 30 hours of running.   
				<br>
				4.	Science<br>
				
				I understand science like ars. It's combine of art and science.
				
				I often find my own way. It's easy because I have only superficial knowledge in all directions. It's really good for me because I haven't restrictions in thoughts. I do all of writings by me and talk with chance when I write something. Because chance – god. And if u can understand chance U may understand all. Like yourself mind or somebody else for example it's small blot or stain from inks near the most powerful word in text.
				
				I do a lot of concepts that in most help world.
				
				In this years I want to make something that may safe us. Do better to your environment and change mind of other people. Because I don't understand than people can't help other people or the worst one, they want to make bad to other. What a f? We are all in one cup of tea. We live in one place on Earth.
				I want to make community when people with mind can change thought. It's simple. I don't understand something like I find it and don't want to said it to someone. People, we are living on planet and try to make humans better. Find interest and points in you to communicate and exchange value. Talk with other and exchange. It's way to be better. If you business find other. If you scientist, find another. It's faster and better anyway.
				
				{A lot of my science connected to study PAGE. Because I interested in all of these directions and all of my concepts showed in the idea page, you may see it.}
				
				<br>
				5.	Art<br>
				
				My art is the part of my soul and this is amazing way to show yourself. I really like it and want to show others.
				
				I have only one name of my painting because I end it. Eposera.
				The next one may be suicvayrduCConstantinius. Because it's my portrait.
				I have first portrait and it's girl that give me oil and solvent. I name it 0 portrait. Because I don't write it before. This picture drawing from her photo, but I do it more colorful. I combine different typesin one and this looks amazing for first one. There are combination of several girls.
				
				The next of them I call later. I only draw them. At the moment I have around 31 paintings, most of them made by oil.
				
				For me art it's ars – from latin lingua. Because in all art I have a lot of science. That can do it better anyway. I create all of paintings for my own hints and researchings of shadow, colors and forms. And if I draw someone alive I dar it from layers, like bones, meat and skin to make them alive.
				It is real truth. <br><br>
				6.	Passion<br>
				
				My passion in this year is studying. Studying everywhere and everytime. I make it when I walk, seat and sometimes when I run.
				
				Everytime I do a lot of things and this give me an action way. I really like live in moving because it's one way to be alive.
				
				My life is full of passion. When I run on streets everyday. I have been dancing during every run. In full night where nobody on the streets I walk and sing. I often watch to the up, for skies and stars. When I run and walk. Only if I do something I watch down.
				
				I really like to hear the music, because it's give me play from ears. I have an melody and often don't think about words, of course words of Queen, ABBA and Michael Jackson amazing. But I really try to find science in songs and show it from body to understand by myself.
				A lot of my general thought in music often connected to words of corse, but only like melody, not like a words.
				
				I like watching and hear only positive things, because I live in positive and present it for others. I don't know what will be after. But my eighteen is very happy in 2019 year. After my naxt stage changing.
				
				I try in passion concentrate not for things in one. I do it in synergy by finding the middle or harmony.
				<br>
				7.	Habits<br>
				
				I have a lot of strange and unique habits. Some of them write everyday statistic. Watch weight, DSP and temperature. One of habits don't spend money without target.
				I everyday wash teeth once. Drink more that 2000 of water. Every day I do more than 10 tasks and 1 target. Wash hands more that 5 times.
				Also I photo all my food. Run everytime then I need to be somewhere, I don't use transport. When I run and hear music I always dance.
				Every my hair skin and blood I save to the box. I text all my supernatural things by time and moment of this, like goosebumps.
				I save every check and ticket. I photo all my rubbish and something more.
				
				So I have interested to daily dozen or meditating, but in most of it I do it not every day.  I may do it by feelings. Sometimes I need concentration and I do air gym. Sometimes I need harmony and I do meditating and sometimes I need energy – I do daily dozen.
				
				I value all water and electricity. I calculate it and make statistics. Everytime when I do something I counting seconds in my mind, how long my water turn on and what's power of stream.
				
				When I sleep I always close the door from everyone by mechanic and physics. Sometimes I write my day hints, from the day practicing.
				
				Every day I have different results, that combined and I always write it for different points. Always when I wash hands I wash face with soap.
				
				At home we have a broken crane and I often place an glass. When it fell I heat water from glass and save water for drink. There are plus from minus. Every day I save about 3000 ml water and drink it all.
				
				Also habit to have something only by me, don't buy, do it by myself from things that around. I often write tasks after day to next day. I often write down questions that I need to ask someone.
				
				I think I have a lot of more habits, but I do not remember all.
				
				<br>
				8.	Dream<br>
				
				I have a lot of additional dreams. But the first one – save humanity.
				
				Some of dreams it's make in real my projects, that I create.
				
				For present moment I have a dream to study in MIT for free.
				
				Some of dreams to talk, meet, dance, sing, work with some of great people, that I show in people page.
				
				I have a lot of dreams from them I create an target and from target – tasks.
				I think that first dream that I may make in real is my site and business from myself
				<br>
				9.	Rest<br>
				
				My rest is changing work.
				
				Sometimes I play football with my friends on street.
				Sometimes I play computer games.
				Sometimes I play chess.
				Sometimes I draw write and modeling.
				Sometimes I meditating, running doing daily dozen.
				<br>
				10.	Sport<br>
				
				Sport for me is the part of life everytime when I left home. Every time I run and dance. With my friends we play to football and like it so much. It's good to play because we like it all. We know us together very good but in most I play without friends. Because they have their team and they don't take me to their team. I play with other people and fast find our contact.
				
				In sport I use for communication verbal communication, I talk by hands and body, fingers and foots. But I think so little part of people can understand me.
				<br>11.	Work<br>
				
				I said it in part of studying. I try to work in different directions and there nothing for me in future I want work only for projects and outsource. I think this way may be more efficient for me, may be I want to help big corporations to give them my view. Or exchange of view.
				<br>
				12.	Illness<br>
				
				I ill in this year 2 times in the start of march and summer.
				
				Also I broke my big finger and have 2 scars.
				<br>
				13.	People<br>
				
				In this year I talk mostly with unknown for me people and this is great talking. I really like it and this is great for me. I really free and open with unknown people.
				
				The best friend in this time is Polina Senko.
				Also I start again talk with all people that remember me from past. And connect with my best friend  during early and middle childhood.
				<br>
				14.	Family<br>
				
				In this year I can't talk with family because I won't be part of it.
				I talk only with brother, sister and my grandmother.
				
				I really can't talk with my parents because they don't understand me in way of intelligence and smart. I try it to do, but they can't understand my specific professional words. They have their problems and I don't think about it.
				
				I really train, play and work with my brother and sister. I make psychosomatic analyze and find their interest and help them. I study with them English, Psychology and with brother I try to understand Latin.
				
				I study my sister how to cook, dance and sing. Also we study healing and teaching.
				
				I study my brother to simple programming. We play football, cook, games, psychology, management, business and some child philosophy.
				
				I have a different games with them one of it – simulation of animals. I simulate animals from body, hands, fingers and all of them needs to win or tame.
				
				For example I have a spider from wrist. There are different types and characteristics. But all of them wins by scratching the palm.
				
				I think that's nice for remembering, concentration, speed and think.
				
				Also I have a useful information. For example a snake – to win snake they need to take it near beginning of wrist. It's like in real life, they need to do it very fast, because my hand fast too.
