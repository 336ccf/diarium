				1.	Computer<br>

				Computer for me was not main part of life. I played a lot to Dota 2. I have at that moment 6000 Mmr than average was 3000. 
				I played for money and after started to create accounts to boost them and sold out (one account may cost 10 000 rubles). 
				To make one account I needed to spend 20-30 hours of playing. I sold about 100 accounts for different people. It was my game business.
				
				My programming in computer started to be better. 
				I came to pre-university courses in ITMO. I was better than all in course. I came to first lesson and did programme for two next. Because I asked and did a lot. On 3rd lesson I did programme from 8th lesson. Every time I asked teacher, what we would do next. Fourth lesson I lost because I was not interested.
				In the end of the year, I did not come very often, because I was not interested. 
				At home, I did more than all of course programme. At home, I created programmes on C++, Python and Ruby. Because I want practice in it.
				I made a lot of money from orders.
				
				At that moment I less interest to have my own sites because every time I wanted to create something new and amazing.
				<br>
				2.	Business<br>
				
				I had 3 small business that I was interested.
				
				I created vape liquids and sold it with marginality 500%. I created a lot bottles from 5 liters of propylenoglicole and 3 liters of glicerine + some aroma. I had an marketing plan and some of managers. 
				After 5 months of this business, I wanted to create something new and started doing prototype of new vape with adult guys. We were seating in vapeshop and do this vape. After one year of creating, we were selling vapes that created on factory. Marginality about 800-900% by one product. Nevertheless, it was teamwork and we separated all benefit.
				
				So at all I had business project by selling my engineering facilities. It was small coilâ€™s for vape, which I did for 1000 rubles or more. This was jewellery's work because coil maximum diameter is 1 mm and all completed coil maximum 10 mm diameter. I created this very good and very fast. So I started business from it, by coming to different vape shops and creating a lot of coils.
				I know about 50 different kinds of coils.
				
				At the 14 years old, I compared computers and sold it in full. I created my design, platform in internet and sold them with marginality 600-2900%. This business I had at the end of 14th years old.
				<br>
				3.	Friends<br>
				
				My best friend at this moment was Max Stratu and company from color festival. This company contain about 12 people. We met on color festival. The best friends of this company were Anastasia Gorshkova, Andrei Gradinskii, Vika, Daniil Firs, Danila Barianov, Dmitrii Barabanov, Viktor Solmanov, Anastasia Ahmetova, Yana Belova.
				We had many fun stories by this environment and I really liked to spend time with them. It was 8th grade and I started to talk with people more.
				<br>
				4.	Passion<br>
				
				My passion at that moment was communicating with other people, trying to combine psycho types. I really like to help people and try to understand them. I had first interest to girl, but it was not coming good. I tried to make life other people better by feeling and support.
				<br>
				5.	Rest<br>
				
				In the most of my rest was talking with people.
				<br>
				6.	Family<br>
				Family all the time could not understand me and all the time they tried control me anyway.
				In this year I sometimes ran from home and did not want to talk with them.
				<br>
				7.	Art<br>
				
				I created art from science and programmes. Sometimes I wrote but not a lot of.
				<br>
				8.	Science<br>
				
				Chemistry, physics, engineering, mathematics, programming and in this years I really started to think about psychology.
				<br>
				9.	Travel<br>
				
				Latvia, Moscow, Egypt
				<br>
				10.	Sport<br>
				
				At this age I enedd my sport facilities like courses and started play only for hobby
